I am hosting a private Internet Relay Chat server on Azure using an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine. The main service i used is ngirc
which is the server and allows users to chat to each other. I also used nginx to host a html dashboard pages which shows the status of my ngircd irc server. This html page is hosted on port 80 and allows me to check if server is online externally without needing to ssh in.

The files I used for my project are:

setup.ps1:
This is a powershell script which i use to automatically create the resource group, Virtual network, Subnet and the virtual machine.
At the start, the script runs a check to see if the resource group 'ca1_rg' already exists. 
If it exists, it warns me and asks if I want to run the teardown script first, and allows me to run teardown script from inside the setup script.
This prevents errors where the script tries to create things that are already there and prevents unintended resource usage.
The script creates the VM using 'az vm create'.
It sets the image to Ubuntu2204 and size to Standard_B1s. it also attaches the 'vm_init.yml' file using the --custom-data flag. This passes my cloud-init config to the VM so it installs Nginx and the IRC server automatically on first boot.
It also opens the necessary ports 6667 for IRC, 80 for Web using 'az vm open-port' with priority numbers to avoid conflicts.

vm_init.yml:
I used cloud-init to configure the VM inside. This automatically installs the packages ngircd, irssi, java, nginx and sets up the files so I don't have to do it manually. It also updates all packages to latest versions. 
Once run, the file creates both a text file to show succesful run and html staatus page.

teardown.ps1
This script cleans up the environment to stop costs.
It deletes the entire resource group 'ca1_rg' using the '--yes' flag so I don't have to type "y" manually.
After deleting, it runs a check command to confirm the group is actually gone and prints a green success message if it is.
